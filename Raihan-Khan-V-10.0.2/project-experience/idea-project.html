                <h2>Fostering Innovation: The iDEA Project's Mission</h2>
                <p>The <strong>Innovation Design and Entrepreneurship Academy (iDEA) Project</strong> is a flagship initiative of the Bangladesh Government's ICT Division, implemented by the Bangladesh Computer Council. Its core mission is to spur innovation, create employment, and build a vibrant national entrepreneurship ecosystem to help realize the vision of Digital Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>A key component of this mission was to organize a massive local training program for over 2,500 aspiring entrepreneurs across the country. My company, <strong>Management and Training International Ltd. (MTI Ltd.)</strong>, was awarded the contract to organize this program. As stipulated in our agreement, a critical deliverable was the development of a comprehensive <strong>Online Training Platform</strong>.</p>
                
                <h2>My Role: Programmer and Developer of the iDEA LMS</h2>
                <p>As a <strong>Programmer</strong> at MTI Ltd., I was entrusted with the development of this platform. The objective was to create a full-featured Learning Management System (LMS) that could handle the entire student lifecycleâ€”from initial registration to course completion and certification. This system, known as the iDEA LMS, became the digital backbone of the entire training initiative.</p>

                <h3>Key Features and Functionality of the LMS</h3>
                <p>The iDEA LMS was a custom-built solution designed to be intuitive for students and powerful for administrators. Based on the project's requirements, I developed the following core features:</p>
                
                <h4>1. Public-Facing Course Portal</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Homepage:</strong> Featured carousel sliders for promotions and a categorized view of available online and offline courses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Detailed Course Pages:</strong> Each course had a dedicated page with comprehensive information, including description, curriculum, teacher profiles, duration, and target audience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Online Enrollment:</strong> An intuitive "Enroll" button on available courses that led students to a detailed registration form.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Robust Student Management System</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Secure Registration:</strong> The system included front-end validation to ensure data integrity (e.g., 11-digit phone numbers, valid email formats, NID/Birth Certificate logic based on age).</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated Email Notifications:</strong> I implemented an automated communication workflow. Students received emails for account verification, selection confirmation (with Moodle login credentials), or rejection, ensuring transparency and efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Student Tracking:</strong> A public feature allowing registered students to check their application status using a unique tracking number.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Comprehensive Admin Panel</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Centralized Dashboard:</strong> Gave administrators a complete overview of all system activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Course and Category Management:</strong> Admins could easily create, edit, and delete course categories and individual courses, populating all the details that appear on the front end.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application Management:</strong> A dedicated section to view, manage, and process student applications. Admins could review student details and then select or reject them for a course with a single click, automatically triggering the appropriate email notification.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Moodle Integration for E-Learning</h4>
                <p>For the e-learning component, the system was integrated with <strong>Moodle</strong>. Upon selection, a student's account was created on the Moodle platform, and their credentials were automatically sent via email. This allowed students to log in to a dedicated e-learning environment to access course materials, submit assignments, take quizzes, and ultimately receive their customized, auto-generated certificates upon completion.</p>

                <h3>Project Impact</h3>
                <p>The successful development and deployment of the iDEA LMS was instrumental in managing the logistics and execution of this large-scale national training program. The platform streamlined the entire administrative process, from student acquisition to final certification, providing an efficient and scalable solution that directly supported the government's goal of fostering entrepreneurship across Bangladesh.</p>
