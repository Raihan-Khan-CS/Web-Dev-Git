             <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; color:#666;">Bangladesh-Bharot Digital Service and Employment Training (BDSET) Project</p>

            <article class="post-content-full">
                <h2>A High-Profile Bi-National Initiative</h2>
                <p>The <strong>Bangladesh-Bharot Digital Service and Employment Training (BDSET)</strong> project was a landmark initiative funded by an Indian grant and executed by the <strong>Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority (BHTPA)</strong>. The project's goal was to provide elite Training of Trainers (ToT) for 30 Bangladeshi professionals in cutting-edge technologies like AI, Machine Learning, and Extended Reality (XR) at premier Indian institutions.</p>
                <p>As per the tender, the project had two main components: arranging the six-month training in India (plus internship) and developing an <strong>"Online Training Management Software with support service."</strong> My company, <strong>Management and Training International Ltd. (MTI Ltd.)</strong>, in a joint venture with Crystal Technology Bangladesh Ltd., won this prestigious contract.</p>

                <h2>My Role: Lead Developer of the Training Centre Management System (TCMS)</h2>
                <p>As a Programmer at MTI Ltd., my primary responsibility was the design, development, and implementation of the <strong>Training Centre Management System (TCMS)</strong>. This web-based software was not just an internal tool but a core deliverable of the project, designed to manage the entire lifecycle of the training program for students in Bangladesh, as specified in the tender's "Section 7. Training Centre Management System (TCMS)".</p>
                <p>The system needed to be robust, scalable, and user-friendly, catering to various users including students, faculty, and administrators with role-based access.</p>

                <h3>Core Features of the TCMS</h3>
                <p>Drawing directly from the project requirements and the user manual, I developed a comprehensive platform with the following key modules:</p>

                <h4>1. Student Lifecycle and Admissions Management</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Online Registration:</strong> A public-facing portal for students to register for courses, with detailed forms capturing personal, academic, and contact information. The system handled validation for NID/Birth Certificates and file uploads (photos, certificates).</li>
                    <li><strong>Paid Course Workflow:</strong> Integrated a payment gateway for paid courses, ensuring registration was only completed after successful payment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enquiry and Admission Management:</strong> An admin backend to manage online enquiries, evaluate student applications, and move them from 'pending' to 'enrolled' status.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Academic and Course Management</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Course and Batch Creation:</strong> An admin interface to create, define, and manage all courses and batches, including details like topics, duration, fees, and start/end dates.</li>
                    <li><strong>E-Library:</strong> A dedicated section for students to access e-books, reference materials, and recorded lectures relevant to their enrolled course.</li>
                    <li><strong>Student Dashboard:</strong> A secure login area for enrolled students to access their course materials, assignments, quizzes, and attendance records.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assessment and Certification:</strong> Functionality for teachers to create and schedule assignments and quizzes. Upon successful completion of all requirements, the system could automatically generate a downloadable PDF certificate for the student.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>3. Administrative Control and Reporting</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control:</strong> A sophisticated permission system allowing the Super Admin to define roles (e.g., Admin, Teacher) and assign specific access rights to different parts of the system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensive Admin Dashboard:</strong> Provided a high-level overview of key metrics like total students, enrollments, rejections, and financial data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial Reporting:</strong> Tools to track fee collections, view pending payments, and generate financial summaries per course or batch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication Hub:</strong> Integrated SMS and Email notification system to communicate with students about registration confirmation, class schedules, fee reminders, and alumni events.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Technical Execution and Coordination</h3>
                <p>This involved a full-stack development approach, encompassing database design, backend logic implementation, and the creation of a user-friendly frontend interface for both students and administrators. I worked in close coordination with the BHTPA tech team to ensure the software met all contractual specifications and delivered a seamless user experience. The result was a powerful, centralized platform that successfully managed all administrative and academic needs of the training programs conducted under the Hi-Tech Park Authority.</p>
